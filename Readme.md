# Obsidian FAR/AIM

The Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) are rules made by the FAA controlling all activities related to aviation in the US. The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the FAA's guide to flight information and ATC procedures.

I've downloaded these and turned them into a huge Obsidian vault. This makes it a lot easier to consume and jump around in. This is a huge improvement over the past where you had to either own a physical copy, navigate cumbersome government websites, or find a good PDF.

## Parts
- [[Index|Federal Aviation Regulations]]
- [[00 Index|Aeronautical Information Manual]]

## Installation and usage
Make sure you have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) installed. Download this repository as a ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/kognise/far-aim/releases/latest), unzip it, and open the folder inside Obsidian. All set? Click around in the folders to the left, or just use the links at the bottom of this file to get oriented.

Right click a file in the file listing and press "Star" to star it. This will cause it to show up in a special tab to organize all your starred pages. If you press the icon that looks like a graph on the left you can open the graph view, which should look something like this:

## Reporting issues
Notice any problems with formatting? Broken links/images? Please create a GitHub issue and I'll take a look.

Side note, I have no idea how legal this is. I personally think it's an amazing resource that should be free but if it isn't, government people are free to contact me at `hi@kognise.dev`.
